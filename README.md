My projects from my SNHU CS250 class.
#**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**#
I start by talking to people who will use the software and by watching how they work. I try to hear not just what they ask for but why they need it — that often reveals the real problem. Then I turn those observations into clear, small pieces of work: what the user needs, what success looks like, and any limits or constraints. Writing user stories (for example, “As a teacher, I want to upload assignments so my students can access them”) keeps the focus on the person who will actually use the feature. User stories help me prioritize what to build first, keep features small and testable, and make it easy to check with users that we’ve solved their problem.
**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
I like to think small and build often. I break problems into tiny, testable pieces, write the simplest code that works, and then improve it. I rely on tests, version control, and frequent integration so I don’t get surprised later. From Agile, I want short cycles (sprints) so we get feedback quickly, regular backlog grooming so we work on what matters, daily check-ins to stay aligned, and retrospectives so we actually learn from mistakes. Those practices help keep the project flexible and reduce wasted effort.
**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
For me it’s about being reliable, humble, and helpful. I show up prepared, communicate clearly, and do what I promise. I try to make others’ lives easier by sharing knowledge (code reviews, docs, or a quick pairing session) and by accepting feedback without getting defensive. When things go wrong, I own my part and help the team fix it rather than shifting blame. Ultimately, being a good teammate means caring about the team’s goals more than personal credit.
